## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**I'm a self-motivated and passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a unique path into tech. After completing my matric (Grade 12), I faced financial challenges that prevented me from studying further right away. I took on various jobs to support my family â€” but my dream of becoming a developer never faded. Years later, I'm now pursuing that goal with purpose and persistence, diving deep into web development and computer science.

I specialize in building responsive, user-focused web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and I love turning ideas into functional, scalable solutions. Whether itâ€™s crafting elegant frontends or engineering solid backends, Iâ€™m all about writing clean, maintainable code and delivering smooth digital experiences.

Iâ€™ve earned the **Full Stack Development Certification from FreeCodeCamp**, completing hundreds of hours of coding challenges and real-world projects. I also proudly completed **Harvardâ€™s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**, which gave me a strong foundation in core programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving.

In 2025, I attended the **FNB Code Academy Bootcamp**, where I worked in teams to build full-stack projects using modern tools like Git, Postman, Firebase, and more. That experience sharpened my skills in both development and collaboration, and gave me a real taste of building production-ready applications in a team setting.

### ğŸ’» What I Work With:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

- **Tools & Extras**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Firebase, Postman, CodePen, FreeCodeCamp
