# 👋 Hi there, I’m Ishmael Mokone

I'm a self-motivated and passionate **Full Stack Web Developer** with a unique path into tech. After completing my matric (Grade 12), I faced financial challenges that prevented me from studying further right away. I took on various jobs to support my family — but my dream of becoming a developer never faded. Years later, I’m now pursuing that goal with purpose and persistence, diving deep into web development and computer science.

🎓 I'm currently studying **Computer Science online at University of the People**, while actively building projects, contributing to open source, and learning something new every day.
